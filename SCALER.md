The choice between `queue_depth` and `http_requests_in_progress_total` depends on what aspect of load you're trying to scale against. Here's a comparison:

### **1. `queue_depth` (Best for Background Jobs or Message Queues)**

‚úîÔ∏è **Best when:**

- Your app processes jobs from a **queue system** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Redis queues).
- You want to scale based on the **number of pending jobs** rather than live HTTP traffic.
- Your services are **asynchronous** (not directly tied to user HTTP requests).

‚úîÔ∏è **Example Usage:**

- If your app has a queue that stores tasks (e.g., image processing, scraping), scaling based on `queue_depth` ensures enough workers exist to handle the backlog efficiently.

---

### **2. `http_requests_in_progress_total` (Best for Web APIs and Real-Time Requests)**

‚úîÔ∏è **Best when:**

- Your app handles **live user traffic** through HTTP requests.
- You need to scale based on the **number of concurrent requests** to prevent slow responses.
- Your service is **synchronous**, and response time is critical.

‚úîÔ∏è **Example Usage:**

- If your app is an API server handling a growing number of live requests, scaling based on `http_requests_in_progress_total` prevents overloading instances.

### **Which One Should You Choose?**

| Metric                            | Best for                           | When to Use                                                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queue_depth`                     | Background workers, job processing | If your app relies on **queues** and scales based on task backlog               |
| `http_requests_in_progress_total` | Web APIs, real-time user traffic   | If your app scales based on **active HTTP requests** to maintain response times |

#### **üöÄ Recommendation:**

- If your Fly.io app serves **real-time HTTP requests**, use **`http_requests_in_progress_total`**.
- If your app **processes jobs from a queue**, use **`queue_depth`**.
- If your app does **both**, consider a **hybrid** approach:
  ```toml
  FAS_PROMETHEUS_QUERY = "sum(http_requests_in_progress_total) + sum(queue_depth)"
  ```
  This scales your app based on both **live traffic and queued tasks**.
